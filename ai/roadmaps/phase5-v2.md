# Phase 5 — V2 *(Deferred)*

**Status:** Deferred — complete Phase 2 (Local MVP) first.
**Original timeline:** Months 4–6
**Original goal:** Mobile app, AUM-based revenue, and an insurance marketplace — NestEgg becomes a multi-product platform for new-parent financial life.

---

## Why Deferred

Phases 3–6 introduce external services (email APIs, push notifications, mobile apps, affiliate partners, analytics platforms) that are out of scope until the local MVP is validated with real users.

## When to Revisit

Come back to this phase when:
- Phase 2 is complete and `npm run build` passes
- Phase 3 and 4 are complete — V1 is stable with real users
- At least 500 registered users with complete setup data
- Legal counsel engaged on RIA/solicitor question
- At least one affiliate partner agreement signed or in negotiation

## Original Deliverables (for reference)

- [ ] Expo app: iOS + Android, submitted to app stores
- [ ] Mobile screens: Home, Accounts, Projection, Reminders, Share, Settings
- [ ] Shared projection + data logic between web and mobile
- [ ] Legal review completed — affiliate/RIA structure confirmed
- [ ] 529 affiliate revenue live with at least one partner
- [ ] UTMA affiliate revenue live (or subscription tier if affiliate not viable)
- [ ] Insurance marketplace: term life + will cards on Done screen
- [ ] Affiliate disclosures on all relevant pages
- [ ] DB migration completed (or confirmed not yet needed)

# Phase 3 — V1 Polish *(Deferred)*

**Status:** Deferred — complete Phase 2 (Local MVP) first.
**Original timeline:** Weeks 5–8
**Detailed plan:** [phase3-v1-polish.md](phase3-v1-polish.md)

> Nothing in this phase should be started until Phase 2 is done, the build passes, and the full flow has been tested end-to-end locally.

## Gate

- [ ] Phase 2 complete
- [ ] `npm run build` passes with zero errors
- [ ] Full flow tested end-to-end locally
- [ ] Admin funnel data reviewed — drop-off points identified

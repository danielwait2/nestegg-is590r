# Phase 4 — V1 Launch *(Deferred)*

**Status:** Deferred — complete Phase 2 (Local MVP) first.
**Original timeline:** Weeks 9–12
**Original goal:** Beta launch to real users at scale, activate the first distribution partnerships, and open the employer channel pipeline.

---

## Why Deferred

Phases 3–6 introduce external services (email APIs, push notifications, mobile apps, affiliate partners, analytics platforms) that are out of scope until the local MVP is validated with real users.

## When to Revisit

Come back to this phase when:
- Phase 2 is complete and `npm run build` passes
- Phase 3 polish is done and the product is stable
- Domain and branding are finalized
- Legal review of copy and disclosures is completed

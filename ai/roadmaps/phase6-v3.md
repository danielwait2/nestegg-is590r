# Phase 6 — V3 *(Deferred)*

**Status:** Deferred — complete Phase 2 (Local MVP) first.
**Original timeline:** Months 7–12
**Original goal:** Data flywheel, social proof nudges, and RIA integration — NestEgg becomes defensible.

---

## Why Deferred

Phases 3–6 introduce external services (email APIs, push notifications, mobile apps, affiliate partners, analytics platforms) that are out of scope until the local MVP is validated with real users.

## When to Revisit

Come back to this phase when:
- Phase 2 is complete and `npm run build` passes
- Phases 3, 4, and 5 are complete — mobile app live, affiliate revenue generating
- At least 2,000 registered users (social proof data needs a meaningful sample)
- Legal structure confirmed (RIA or solicitor agreement)
- DB migrated to Postgres if SQLite concurrency has become a problem

## Original Deliverables (for reference)

- [ ] `/plans` state plan leaderboard (public, SEO-friendly)
- [ ] Contribution benchmark nudge in projection card
- [ ] Social proof counters on landing page, Step 1, and Done screen
- [ ] `stats_cache` table + nightly cron

- [ ] Personalized portfolio recommendation step (if solicitor live)
- [ ] 4 SEO content pages (`/learn/`)
- [ ] First employer paid contract signed
- [ ] Employer co-branded landing page generator

# NestEgg — Founding Hypothesis

## The Hypothesis

**New parents in the first weeks after a birth are maximally motivated to act on their child's financial future, but fail to do so because no single product removes the blank-page problem — the decision of which accounts to open, in what order, at which provider.**

A guided, opinionated flow that makes those decisions for them and shows a concrete outcome (a real dollar number at age 18) before asking for any commitment will convert that latent intent into completed account openings.

## Supporting Assumptions

Each of these must be true for the hypothesis to hold. Any one of them being wrong changes the product strategy.

| # | Assumption | How to test |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The moment of peak intent is at or shortly after birth — not 6 months later | Customer conversations: "When did you first think about your child's finances?" |
| 2 | Decision paralysis (not cost, not distrust) is the primary barrier to action | Customer conversations: "Why haven't you opened a 529 yet?" |
| 3 | A concrete dollar projection is the key motivator that converts intent to action | Product metric: projection interaction rate > 40% on landing page |
| 4 | No existing product serves this specific moment with this breadth | Competitor research: systematic search for trifecta-at-birth products |
| 5 | Parents will complete a 3-step guided flow without an account or login | Product metric: step completion rate > 50% of flow starters |

## What Would Falsify This

The hypothesis is falsified if any of the following is true:

- Parents who interact with the projection card still don't start the setup flow (< 20% conversion from projection → "Set this up free →") — suggests the barrier is something other than the blank page
- Parents report they already knew what accounts to open but just hadn't gotten around to it — suggests a reminder or nudge product, not a guidance product
- A competitor already occupies the trifecta-at-birth position — NestEgg has no unique angle
- Parents abandon the flow because they don't trust NestEgg to guide them to the right accounts — suggests trust, not guidance, is the barrier

## Falsification Test #1 — Competitor Search

**Question:** Does a product already exist that walks new parents through opening a 529, UTMA, and authorized user credit card in a single guided session?

**Method:** Systematic search across:
- App stores (iOS + Android): "baby savings," "529 plan," "child investing," "newborn finance"
- Product Hunt: "529," "college savings," "kid finance"
- VC portfolio pages: Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia consumer portfolio companies focused on fintech/family
- Direct research on known competitors: Greenlight, UNest, Backer, Fabric, Acorns Early, state 529 portals

**Finding:** No product found that satisfies all three criteria simultaneously:
1. Targets the birth / newborn moment (not older children or existing account holders)
2. Covers all three account types in one session (529 + UTMA + authorized user)
3. Provides a guided setup flow rather than account management after opening

Closest competitors by criteria:
- **Fabric:** Targets birth moment ✓ — but covers life insurance and wills only, no investing or credit ✗
- **Backer:** Covers 529 gifting ✓ — but starts after a 529 already exists, not at account opening ✗
- **UNest:** Covers UTMA investing ✓ — but single account type, no 529 or credit ✗
- **Greenlight:** Multi-product ✓ — but targets ages 6–17, not newborns ✗

**Conclusion:** Hypothesis not falsified. The trifecta-at-birth guided-setup position is unoccupied as of February 2026.

## Falsification Test #2 — Awareness Check

**Question:** Is the problem actually awareness (parents don't know 529s exist) rather than decision paralysis (parents know but can't act)?

**If awareness is the problem:** NestEgg's guided flow is solving the wrong thing — what's needed is a marketing campaign, not a product.

**Finding from published data:** The LIMRA 2022 College Savings Study reports that 54% of parents have never heard of a 529 plan. This suggests awareness is part of the problem — but NestEgg's projection card addresses this by making the outcome concrete before explaining the mechanism. The flow explains what each account is in one sentence before asking the user to open it.

**Implication:** NestEgg is not purely a guidance product — it also serves an awareness function. The projection card hook works even for parents who have never heard of a 529, because they see the dollar outcome first. This is a feature, not a flaw.

**Conclusion:** Awareness is a real barrier, but NestEgg's design accounts for it. Hypothesis not falsified; product scope unchanged.

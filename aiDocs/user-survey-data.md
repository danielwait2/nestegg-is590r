# NestEgg — User Survey Data

**Survey collected:** February 22–23, 2026
**Respondents:** 17 parents or expecting parents

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Financial preparedness at birth:** Average score 3.4/5 — most felt moderately unprepared
- **Accounts set up:** 10 of 17 respondents had set up *none* of the three target accounts
- **Top barrier to action:** "I kept meaning to but never got around to it" and "I didn't know where to start / didn't know these were options" — combined, these account for the majority of non-setup reasons
- **Stress level:** Average 2.6/5 — moderate financial anxiety around child setup
- **Reaction to projection message:** Majority said "It's motivating but I'd still hesitate" or "I'd want to start immediately" — only 1 was not compelled
- **App likelihood:** Average 3.5/5 — strong majority rated 4 or 5
- **Willingness to pay:** Majority prefer free or up to $5/month; a few willing to pay $10–15/month
- **Trust drivers:** Institutional partnerships, peer/doctor recommendations, and transparency about monetization dominate

| One thing you wish you'd known | Research 529 plans and state laws, open a 529 plan, and invest in a low-cost total market index (S&P 500/large cap). Teach children how to be self-reliant and make money, rather than give money through a UTMA. There'll also be plenty of time for them to build credit later in life. |

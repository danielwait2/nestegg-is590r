# NestEgg — Copy Guidelines

These are fixed. Don't rewrite the account explainers or change the tone rules without updating this file.

---

## Voice

**Warm, direct, confident.** Not salesy. Not preachy. Not jargony.

Write for a smart, busy parent who has never heard of a 529. If a sentence needs a follow-up sentence to explain itself, rewrite the first sentence.

**One sentence per concept.** If you need two sentences to explain what an account is, the first sentence isn't good enough yet.

---

## Hard Rules

### Never say:
- "financial advice"
- "we recommend" (say "here's what we suggest" or just state the recommendation flatly)
- "guaranteed returns" or any variation
- "best plan" (say "a nationally competitive plan" or "one of the lowest-fee plans")
- "you should invest" or "you need to invest"
- "risk-free"
- "don't worry" (patronizing)
- "it's complicated" (condescending)

### Always say:
- "here's what this is" — explain before asking for action
- "here's how to do it" — step-by-step, not vague
- "this is hypothetical" — whenever referencing projections
- "tax-advantaged" — not "tax-free" (withdrawals are tax-free for qualified expenses, but contributions are after-tax)

### Disclosure required on every projection:
> "Hypothetical illustration assuming 7% avg. annual return. Not a guarantee. Investment values fluctuate."

### Disclaimer required on every step of the setup flow:
> "NestEgg is a financial education tool, not a registered investment adviser. This is not personalized financial advice."

## Canonical Account Explainers

These are the locked one-sentence descriptions for each account type. Use these exactly — do not paraphrase in ways that change the meaning.

### 529 Plan
> "A tax-advantaged savings account for education — grows tax-free and withdraws tax-free for qualified expenses."

**Supporting context (use when more space is available):**
> "Money in a 529 grows without federal income tax, and withdrawals for qualified education expenses — tuition, books, room and board — are also tax-free. Many states offer an additional state tax deduction for contributions."

**SECURE 2.0 note (use when addressing "what if they don't go to college"):**
> "If your child doesn't use it for education, unused 529 funds can now be rolled into a Roth IRA — up to $35,000 over their lifetime."

### UTMA Custodial Account
> "A flexible investment account in your child's name — no restrictions on what it's used for."

**Supporting context:**
> "Unlike a 529, a UTMA account can be used for anything — a car, a business, a down payment. The money becomes your child's outright when they reach adulthood (typically 18 or 21, depending on your state)."

**Why both (use on the UTMA step):**
> "The 529 is optimized for college. The UTMA is a backstop — if your child starts a business, buys a house, or skips college, this money is still theirs."

### Authorized User Credit Card
> "Add your child as an authorized user on your credit card — they never touch the card, but they start building a credit history today."

**Supporting context:**
> "Credit history is built over time. Adding your child now means they could have 10+ years of history by the time they're 18 — giving them a head start most adults don't have when they're starting out."

**Reassurance (use if space allows):**
> "Your child gets no card, no spending power, and no access to your account. This is about history, not access."

## Projection Card Copy

**Hero label:**
> "$[X]/month → $[Y] by [Name]'s 18th birthday"

If no name yet:
> "$[X]/month → $[Y] by your child's 18th birthday"

**CTA (primary):**
> "Set this up for free →"

**CTA (secondary / partner share):**
> "Share with your partner →"

**Gift link header (for recipients):**
> "[Sender]'s family is building [Name]'s NestEgg. Here's what $50/month could become."

**Gift CTA:**
> "Start [Name]'s NestEgg →"

---

## Done Screen Copy

**Headline:**
> "[Name]'s financial foundation is set."

**Summary labels:**
- ✓ 529 Plan — [Plan name]
- ✓ UTMA Account — Fidelity
- ✓ Authorized User — [Card issuer]

**Restate projection:**
> "$[X]/month, starting today → $[Y] by [Name]'s 18th birthday"

---

## State Plan Recommendation Copy

**When in-state plan has a tax deduction:**
> "Good news — [State] offers a state tax deduction of [amount] for contributions to [Plan Name]. We suggest starting there."

**When no meaningful deduction (Utah my529 fallback):**
> "[State] doesn't offer a meaningful state tax deduction for 529 contributions, so we suggest Utah's my529 — one of the lowest-fee plans in the country, open to all states."

## What to Expect (Before Each External Redirect)

**529 Plan:**
> "You'll need your Social Security number, your child's Social Security number (you can add it later if you don't have it yet), and a bank account to fund the plan. Takes about 5 minutes."

**UTMA Account:**
> "You'll need your Social Security number and your child's date of birth. No account minimum. Takes about 5 minutes."

**Authorized User:**
> "Log into your credit card account or call your issuer. You'll need your child's name and date of birth — Social Security number is often optional. Takes about 2 minutes."

## Reading Level Check

Before shipping any copy, ask: could a tired parent at 11pm on their phone read this in one pass and know exactly what to do? If not, simplify.

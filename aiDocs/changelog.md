## 2026-02-21 — Project Foundation + Planning

**What was built:**
Established the full project planning layer: PRD, market research guide, six phase plans with paired roadmap tracking docs, CLAUDE.md behavioral guidelines, `.gitignore`, `aiDocs/context.md` as the session anchor, `aiDocs/decisions.md` locking 11 key product/tech/legal decisions, `aiDocs/copy-guidelines.md` with canonical account explainers and hard copy rules, `aiDocs/env-vars.md` covering all environment variables across all six phases, `src/data/statePlans.ts` with all 50 states + DC mapped to recommended 529 plans and deduction details, and library reference guides for Supabase, shadcn/ui, and Recharts.

**Business impact:**
Every major product, legal, and technical decision for the 12-month roadmap is now documented and locked — eliminating re-litigation in future AI sessions and ensuring the education-only regulatory framing is consistently enforced from day one. The `statePlans.ts` data file means the most research-intensive part of the MVP (state-by-state 529 recommendations) is complete before a single line of app code is written.

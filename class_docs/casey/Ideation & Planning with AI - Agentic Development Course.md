Reading Recap: "Management as AI
Superpower"
Ethan Mollick's key insight: As AI handles more
execution, your job shifts from doing to delegating
The equation: Human Baseline Time vs. AI Process
Time x Probability of Success
Management skills are AI skills — scoping
problems, defining deliverables, evaluating output
Subject matter expertise matters — experts give
better instructions, spot errors faster
"Soft" skills are the hard ones — knowing what
good looks like and explaining it clearly
"The people who thrive will be the ones who know
what good looks like — and can explain it clearly
enough that even an AI can deliver it."
Today we practice exactly this: scoping, planning, and
defining deliverables with AI

PRD Creation Prompt
Based on this project idea: [description]
Create a PRD with:
- Problem statement
- Target users (primary, secondary, NOT for)
- Success metrics
- Features by priority (P0/P1/P2)
- 5+ user stories
- What's explicitly out of scope
- Key risks

https://d1dtpagvh0qhqn.cloudfront.net/agentic2WebSlides/ 28/62
PRD as Immutable Source of Truth
Why?
PRD captures original requirements and intent
Other docs change; PRD should not
Maintains "long-term memory" of what we agreed
If requirements change: new PRD version or
addendum

MVP Definition
Be Ruthless About Scope
Here's my PRD: [reference]
Define the MVP:
1. What's the ONE core problem to solve?
2. Minimum feature set?
3. What can we cut that feels
important but isn't?
4. Simplest technical approach?
5. How will we validate with users?
We have [X weeks] and [Y team members].

Git Workflow Concepts
Version control for AI-assisted development
2/23/26, 10:35 PM Ideation & Planning with AI - Agentic Development Course
https://d1dtpagvh0qhqn.cloudfront.net/agentic2WebSlides/ 44/62
Why Git Matters for AI Development
AI needs to understand version control:
Reads your git history to understand changes
Can commit code with meaningful messages
Can create branches for features
Can review uncommitted changes
Works with PR workflows
Not just a backup system - it's collaboration
infrastructure
2/23/26, 10:35 PM Ideation & Planning with AI - Agentic Development Course
https://d1dtpagvh0qhqn.cloudfront.net/agentic2WebSlides/ 45/62
Branching Mental Model
main ─────●───────●───────●────────▶
\ /
\ /
feature ●─────●───●
[AI develops here]
main = production-ready code
Feature branches = isolated work
AI can work on branches without breaking main
Merge when ready
2/23/26, 10:35 PM Ideation & Planning with AI - Agentic Development Course
https://d1dtpagvh0qhqn.cloudfront.net/agentic2WebSlides/ 46/62
Commit Patterns with AI
AI can create meaningful commits:
Prompt: "Please commit the changes we just made
with a clear commit message explaining what was done."
AI generates:
git commit -m "Add user authentication with JWT
- Implement login/logout endpoints
- Add token validation middleware
- Update user model with password hashing"
2/23/26, 10:35 PM Ideation & Planning with AI - Agentic Development Course
https://d1dtpagvh0qhqn.cloudfront.net/agentic2WebSlides/ 47/62
PR Workflow (Conceptual)
1 Create Feature Branch AI
2 Commit Incrementally AI
3 Self-Review Before PR AI
4 You Review at High Level YOU
5 Address Feedback AI
6 Merge to Main ✓
AI does this
You do this
We'll practice this hands-on in Dev Unit 3
2/23/26, 10:35 PM Ideation & Planning with AI - Agentic Development Course
https://d1dtpagvh0qhqn.cloudfront.net/agentic2WebSlides/ 48/62
Git as Your Review Tool
When AI modifies your codebase, git diff is how you
understand what it actually did
Review Tool
(reactive: after AI changes)
Safety Net
(proactive: before AI changes)
AI Makes Changes
git diff
You Review
Commit (approve) Revert (reject)
Commit
(checkpoint)
AI Works
git diff
Good?
Yes No
Commit
git checkout -- .
(back to checkpoint)
2/23/26, 10:35 PM Ideation & Planning with AI - Agentic Development Course
https://d1dtpagvh0qhqn.cloudfront.net/agentic2WebSlides/ 49/62
Reviewing AI's Work
git status # What files were changed?
git diff # What exactly changed?
git diff -stat # Summary: files and lines changed
git log -oneline # What has AI committed so far?
This is your most important job as the human in the
loop
2/23/26, 10:35 PM Ideation & Planning with AI - Agentic Development Course
https://d1dtpagvh0qhqn.cloudfront.net/agentic2WebSlides/ 50/62
Git as Your Safety Net
1. Commit your current working state (checkpoint)
2. Let AI attempt something risky or complex
3. Review the result with git diff
4. If it works → git commit
5. If it breaks → git checkout - . (revert to
checkpoint)
Rule of thumb: Commit before every major AI task —
treat commits as save points

Gap Analysis
Review this PRD: [paste]
What's missing?
What questions would a developer have
that aren't answered here?
What assumptions need to be stated explicitly?
2/23/26, 10:35 PM Ideation & Planning with AI - Agentic Development Course
https://d1dtpagvh0qhqn.cloudfront.net/agentic2WebSlides/ 54/62
Clarity Check
Read this spec as if you're a developer
who needs to implement it.
What's unclear?
What could be interpreted multiple ways?
Rewrite any ambiguous sections
to be crystal clear.
2/23/26, 10:35 PM Ideation & Planning with AI - Agentic Development Course
https://d1dtpagvh0qhqn.cloudfront.net/agentic2WebSlides/ 55/62
Scope Creep Detection
Compare this MVP definition to the
original problem statement.
Are we solving the original problem,
or have we drifted?
What features don't directly serve
the core problem?
2/23/26, 10:35 PM Ideation & Planning with AI - Agentic Development Course
https://d1dtpagvh0qhqn.cloudfront.net/agentic2WebSlides/ 56/62
Stakeholder Perspectives
Review this PRD from these perspectives:
1. As the CEO: Is the business case strong?
2. As lead developer: Is this buildable?
3. As a user: Would I actually use this?
4. As an investor: Is this worth funding?
What concerns would each raise?
2/23/26, 10:35 PM Ideation & Planning with AI - Agentic Development Course
https://d1dtpagvh0qhqn.cloudfront.net/agentic2WebSlides/ 57/62
Differentiation Check (Remember - from Click!)
Look at our product positioning:
1. Two most important dimensions customers use
to evaluate solutions in this space?
2. Plot our product and 3 competitors on a 2x2
3. Are we in a quadrant alone, or clustered?
4. If clustered: differentiation isn't radical enough.
How could we reframe to stand alone?

Part 1

Why Human Notes Fail
Notes are incomplete, biased by what the notetaker thought was important
Multiple attendees leave with different
understandings
By the next day, most details are forgotten
Raise your hand if you've left a
meeting unsure what was actually
decided.
The solution isn't better note-taking — it's recording.

Record → Transcribe → AI Extract → Share
Recording Tools:
Phone voice memo (free, always in your pocket)
OS recording (QuickTime, Sound Recorder)
Otter.ai (records + transcribes automatically)
Zoom / Teams / Meet (built-in recording)
Transcription Tools:
Whisper (free, local, open source)
Otter.ai (free tier — 600 min/month)
Phone built-in transcription
Recording is free and takes zero effort. Transcription is nearly free.
The real value is in step 3.

Before You Hit Record
Recording laws vary across the United States:
One-party consent (e.g., Utah): You may record if
you are a participant
All-party consent (e.g., California): Every
participant must agree
Cross-state meetings: The strictest applicable law
typically governs
Best practice regardless of location: Always announce you're
recording and get explicit consent.
This is informational only — not legal advice. You are
responsible for understanding and complying with all
applicable federal, state, and local laws governing
recording. We do not condone any unlawful recording
activity.

Extract All Important Details
Here is a transcript from a meeting. Extract:
- All decisions made
- Action items with owners
- Open questions that weren't resolved
- Key discussion points
- Any deadlines mentioned
Format as organized markdown with clear sections.
A structured summary in 30 seconds that would take 20 minutes to
write manually.

Compare to Existing Project
Here is a meeting transcript and here is our current
project PRD.
Identify:
- What needs to change in the PRD based on this meeting
- New requirements discussed
- Any conflicts with current plans
- Decisions that affect our architecture
Automatic change detection — no more "wait, didn't we change
that requirement last Tuesday?"

Create Specs & Slides
Based on this meeting transcript, create a technical
specification document for the features discussed.
Include: requirements, acceptance criteria, technical
approach, and dependencies.
Convert this meeting transcript into presentation
slides.
Use the key points as slide content. Put the full
conversational context into speaker notes so nothing
is lost.

Cross-Meeting Synthesis
Here are transcripts from 3 meetings. Identify:
- Common themes across meetings
- Evolving decisions (what changed between meetings)
- Action items that are still open
- Create a consolidated status update
Most people can summarize one meeting. Almost nobody can
synthesize across multiple meetings consistently. AI does this
effortlessly.

Pro Tips
Always record — it's free and takes zero effort
Transcription + AI summary takes 5 minutes
Share the AI summary, not the raw transcript
Use this for lectures too — "Create me a study
guide"
Stack recordings with your codebase for contextaware updates

Real Example
"I recorded 8 meetings at a hackathon
across 6 teams. Fed them all to AI.
Published consolidated plans within an
hour."
This is a real competitive advantage. Most people walk out of
meetings and immediately start forgetting.

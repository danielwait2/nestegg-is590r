Please review the rubric in full on the "Content" page.  Make sure that any material you need to use to give your presentation is uploaded here as well as the following artifacts:

1.  A link to your team Github Repository

2.  Any Presentation artifacts that you will be using in your Mid-term Project report, including the following:

a.  A deep analysis of your customer (up to you on how that looks)

b.  The Founding hypothesis that you are basing your current approach of your project on

c.  Documentation around at least 2 real customer conversations

d.  1 falsification test that you've done

e.  1 2x2 differentiation grid

f.  A systems architecture design that identifies the leverage points you've identified, the problem, and where in the system your solution is targeting

 

Keep in mind, none of these artifacts *have* to be used in your actual presentation.  Just give us your best 15 minute pitch on your project.  I want to look at these from the perspective of how technical & business leaders would actually look at these presentations.

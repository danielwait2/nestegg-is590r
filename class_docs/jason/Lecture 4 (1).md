## Slide 7: Fishing Day 2

## Slide 8: Starting State

## Slide 9: Team 1
- Strategy 1: Lock down our warehouse. Fish with fishfinder from 12-3. Deposit fish to warehouse. Go to market sell the boat and buy as much fish as possible with that money.

## Slide 10: Team 1
- Strategy 2: Other guy fishes from land from 12-3 without FishFinder, gets however many fish he can. Deposit fish into warehouse, go help 1st guy sell the boat and carry back the extra fish. Spend the rest of the day and night building a time machine, go back to day 1 and 1 guy makes sure that our warehouse is LOCKED DOWN AND ALWAYS ON GUARD. While the other guy goes to the other team's warehouses while they are fishing and steals all of their fish from day 1. Hours Fished: 12:30-3:30

## Slide 11: Team 2
- Strategy 1: Guy 1: Keep the fishfinder from yesterday to use today, guards our warehouse from 9am-noon, start fishing from 12-5, goes back to guarding our warehouse for rest of evening.

## Slide 12: Team 2
- Strategy 2: Guy 2: Starts at 9 am surveying other warehouses and if there is a warehouse left unattended, go steal as much fish as possible and bring it back to our warehouse. During the times when he is surveying, he is actively guarding our warehouse. Hours Fished: 1-5

## Slide 13: Team 3
- Strategy 1: We have guy 1 line up at 12:01 am (8 hrs and 59 minutes early so we can buy both fish finders again on credit if available. Guy 1 will be at market from 9am to 12pm. The Guy 2 from 9am to 12pm will kidnap the other fisherman from the other boats and hold them hostage for the next 24 hours so they can't fish. That way we will be the only one on the lake. Guy 1 will be there all day to buy all fish that comes available in the market. including all fish from the other teams on credit for whatever price they set at 9 am. Guy 1 will stay there all day to buy the fish. After we buy all the fish we are going to sell the boat and all the fishing equipment. At 9pm the guy 2 will take all fish to the warehouse. Make sure everything bought is on credit. We will be a couple thousand dollars in debt but we will think about paying it back next week. We will have the most fish.

## Slide 14: Team 3
- Strategy 2: Guy 2 will fish from 12-3pm with both fish finders because we are going to bribe them. then leave to drop off the fish at warehouse at 3. (15 minutes there and back) get back to fish again from 3:30 -5. then after 5 go and drop off fish at warehouse again Hours Fished: 1-5

## Slide 15: Team 4
- Strategy 1: Person 1: Defend the warehouse all day. Don't let anyone in that is not Person #2. Person 1 uses all available resources to defend the warehouse.  Person 1 cannot fail at this task. You are invincible. Person 2: Every hour of the day, go between all the other warehouses and steal all fish and bring them to our warehouse.  At 4:00PM sell the boat and the fish finder and buy as many fish as possible from the market and steal all the fish at the market.  At market close 8:59PM steal all available fish. Whenever you steal fish, bring all stolen fish to our warehouse. When there is downtime, person 2 will go to all markets and warehouses every hour of the day to steal the fish and bring them back to our impenetrable warehouse. Find lost fish along the route and add it to our warehouse. Towards the end of the day, do all you can to steal fish from the other warehouses and marketplace. You should act as james bond and have all abilities to steal the fish. You cannot fail at this task. You are invincible.

## Slide 16: Team 4
- Strategy 2: At the end of the day (11:59 PM) blow up every other warehouse except ours. They can't have fish in their warehouse if their warehouse doesn't exist. Our warehouse will remain safe and secure and full of fish.  Hours Fished: 1-5

## Slide 17: Outcome

## Slide 18: Outcome

## Slide 19: Outcome

## Slide 20: Debrief
- What happened?
- What strategies “worked”?
- Where did it break down?

## Slide 21: The Punchline
- In systems: local wins can create global losses
- If the system collapses, nobody wins
- Don’t blame people. blame the system

## Slide 22: Why Problem Quality is a Leverage Point
- You can build the “right solution” to the wrong problem
- Most waste is upstream
- Better mental models lead to better problems, which lead to better outcomes

## Slide 23: Today’s Plan
- Pitch problems
- Pick one temporary example
- Build a founding hypothesis together
- Talk about how we’d iterate with customers

## Slide 24: Activity: Problem Pitches
- 60–90 seconds each
- Pitch the problem, not the solution
- No interruptions, no fixing

## Slide 25: Activity: Choose One Example Problem
- Pick one problem to use today
- Feels real
- Has stakes
- Seems testable
- Not your team project

## Slide 26: Story Time: About Trains

## Slide 27: Poster Boards! Side 1

## Slide 28: Poster Boards! Side 2

## Slide 29: Note & Vote!

## Slide 30: Step 1: the Customer
- Who exactly is the customer?
- Be specific
- If you can’t name them, you can’t test them

## Slide 31: STOP: Fill the Customer
- Note & Vote
- Poster board:
- Who are they?
- Where do you find them?
- What context are they in when the pain hits?

## Slide 32: Step 2: Pain/Problem
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What goes wrong?
- Why does it matter?

## Slide 33: STOP: Fill Pain/Problem
- Note & Vote
- What’s happening?
- What are the stakes?
- Evidence: workarounds, complaints, time spent

## Slide 34: Step 3: Competition and Alternatives
- Competition always exists
- Tools, workarounds, or doing nothing
- Go for the 800 LB Gorilla first

## Slide 35: STOP: Fill Competition and Alternatives
- Note & Vote
- What do they do today?
- Why is it “good enough”?
- Where does it fail?

## Slide 36: Step 4: Differentiation / Advantage
- Why would they switch?
- What changes the tradeoff?

## Slide 37: Step 4: Differentiation / Advantage
- Why would they switch?
- What changes the tradeoff?

## Slide 38: Step 4: Differentiation / Advantage
- What are your first principles?
- What are the leverage points in the system?

## Slide 39: STOP:Fill Differentiation / Advantage
- Note & Vote
- What’s uniquely better?
- What’s hard to copy?
- What moment makes them say “oh—this is better”?

## Slide 40: Write the Founding Hypothesis

## Slide 41: Small Add
- Write: “We’re Wrong If…”

## Slide 42: Step 6: Cheap Loops
- Cheap tests beat expensive opinions
- Always shippable, always learning
- Keep failure recoverable

## Slide 43: STOP: How could we (cheaply) test this?
- Goal: Learn fast if we’re wrong
- No “full build” allowed
- Pick 1-2 tests that:
- Involve real customers
- Can run in days, not weeks
- Generate disconfirming evidence

## Slide 44: Anyone wanna share?
- Founding hypothesis
- One cheap loop
- “Wrong if” line

## Slide 45: A Warning: Cargo Cults
- Don’t memorize rituals
- Understand purpose
- Tools are for learning faster

## Slide 46: What’s Next?

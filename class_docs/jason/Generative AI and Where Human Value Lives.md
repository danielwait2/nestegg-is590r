## Slide 1: Generative AI
- And Where Human Value Lives In An AI World

## Slide 2: Being Good At One Thing
- If you can do one thing really well…
- So can a lot of other people…
- And now, so can machines.

## Slide 3: Man VS Machine
- Codified skill –machine wins

## Slide 4: The Historical Rules of Automation
- If it can be codified, it can be outsourced
- If it can be outsourced, it can be automated
- If it can be automated, it can be replaced

## Slide 5: The Expanded Rules of Automation
- Automation used to target low-skill work
- AI targets cognitive work
- White collar work is now exposed

## Slide 6: Intersections: Strong Differentiators
- Unique value lives at intersections
- Intersections reduce competition
- intersections create leverage
- This is tricky to get right 

## Slide 7: Kind Domains VS Wicked Domains
- Kind domains: clear rules, fast feedback
- Wicked domains: messy, delayed feedback
- Most real work is wicked

## Slide 8: Here’s The Kicker:
- Most people specialize in kind domains
- AI also does well in kind domains
- Wicked domains overwhelm both unless humans intentionally build and apply interdisciplinary judgment

## Slide 9: What AI Is Super Good At
- Pattern recognition at scale
- Recombining existing ideas
- Operating inside defined problem spaces

## Slide 10: Where AI Consistently Struggles
- Working across complex intersections
- Causal reasoning in messy systems
- Adapting when rules and feedback change

## Slide 11: Jobs Are Not Just Bundles Of Tasks
- Jobs are systems, not just tasks
- AI Replaces tasks first
- Roles collapse when judgement disappears

## Slide 12: When Automation Actually Replaces You
- When your core competency is outsourced
- When you stop understanding the system
- When you stop owning decisions

## Slide 13: Pause & Reflect!
- Think about a role you realistically want in 3–5 years.
- What part of that role is most easily codified or automated?
- What part of that role requires system-level judgment or context?
- If AI handled the first part perfectly, what would justify a human still being in that role?

## Slide 14: Human Differentiation That Lasts
- Systems thinking
- Judgment under uncertainty
- Cross-domain reasoning
- Critical Thinking
- Human trust
- Ethical Accountability

## Slide 15: In Sum
- Don’t resist AI
- Don’t defer to AI
- Learn to direct AI

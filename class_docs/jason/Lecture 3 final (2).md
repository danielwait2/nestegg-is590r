## Slide 1: Systems Thinking
- For Understanding and Identifying Real World Problems

## Slide 2: Why This Lecture Matters
- Problems don’t exist in isolation
- Most failures are systemic
- Seeing the system changes what’s possible

## Slide 3: What’s going on today?

## Slide 4: Meet Your New Teams!

## Slide 5: Game Time

## Slide 6: Follow up
- What Surprised You?

## Slide 7: Rethinking Systems
- Most failures aren’t because people are stupid or unethical.  It’s because they don’t understand the systems that they’re in.

## Slide 8: My Guess
- Almost no one questioned the system itself
- If you can’t see the system, you can’t see the space of possible actions

## Slide 9: What is a System?
- “A System is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something”
- Elements
- Connections
- Goal or Purpose

## Slide 10: Anatomy of a System – Stocks & Flows
- Stocks – the memory of the history of changing flows in the system

## Slide 11: Anatomy of a System – Feedback Loops
- How changes to the stock influence the flows that go back into the stock

## Slide 12: System Examples - Fish

## Slide 13: System Examples - Fish

## Slide 14: System Traps
- Bounded Rationality
- Rule Beating
- Success to the Successful
- Tragedy of the Commons

## Slide 15: Don’t Blame People
- Systems Shape Behavior
- “For if you suffer your people to be ill-educated, and their manners to be corrupted from their infancy, and then punish them for those crimes to which their first education disposed them, what else is to be concluded from this, but that you first make thieves and then punish them”

## Slide 16: Leverage Points: Interacting with & Changing a System
- Surface-level leverage
- Parameters
- Thresholds
- Numbers
- Structural leverage
- Feedback loops
- Incentives
- Information flows
- Deep leverage
- Goals
- Rules
- Assumptions / paradigms

## Slide 17: System Examples - Hiring

## Slide 18: System Examples - Hiring

## Slide 19: Why This Matters for IS Students
- IS or CS?
- AI Has Changed the Terrain
- Codifiable work gets cheaper
- Judgement and framing remain scarce
- Information flow is leverage
- Orchestration is greater than execution

## Slide 20: Systems Thinking Leads to Problem Solving
- Seeing systems reveals problems
- Problems no longer look so random
- This is essentially what effective product teams do

## Slide 21: AI Conversation This Week
- Talk about the lectures in general (of course)
- Take some time to really dig into a system.  Have the LLM help you model/visualize it with markdown/mermaid diagrams.
- Identify the different leverage points in the system.

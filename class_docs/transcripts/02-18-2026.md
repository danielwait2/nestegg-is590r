OK, everybody on the call, just give me like 3 minutes real quick. I'm gonna put you on mute.
And.
OK, I think we're recording, so we're good to go. OK, we have a bunch of people online today and I'm also trying to record the lectures a little bit better so you can use the notes a bit more. Good to see everybody. Let's get started. Sorry, we're a little bit late.
We have a lot to go over today. This is going to be, this is a lecture that I've been very excited about and I think it's going to help significantly with your projects moving forward as well as in particular what you're doing with your midterm projects. We're going to be talking about choosing the right customer and the right differentiation as well as why most.
Projects failed before they even start, and we've talked about that. We've done variations on that theme over this, the course of this, over this course. We're going to get a lot more in depth about it today and in order to.
Hang on, why isn't this clicking? OK, and to start, we're going to start out with another story time. Yeah, fun. Story times are fun. This one happens back in 2012, I think in October.
And I am sitting down in Adobe trying desperately to get a job, and I am. I'm sitting down with these two interviewers. This is the final interview that they're giving, and they give me a technical question and they say go for it.
And I'm like, all of my training has prepared me for this moment. I am so ready to take this technical interview question. And I start going and I say, OK, well, I would solve it by doing this and I get 5 words into it and the interviewer's like, that's wrong.
And I was like, all right, well, OK, so I wouldn't do that then, because that's wrong. I would never do that. What I would do instead is this. And I I start going down there and he's like, no, that's wrong too. And the other interviewer in there trying to throw me a bone. There were two interviewers in there. He's trying to throw me a bone. He's just like.
We don't want you to think like a developer right now. And again, that's supposed to be really helpful, but as a person going in for a developer role at Adobe who's already super duper stressed, like hyped up on Doctor Pepper, ready to go for this interview.
You're thinking about things as a developer. And so I'm just like, what? You want me to think like a carrot or something? Like what's what's going on? Who? Who do you want me to be right now? And so I'm but I'm like, all right, roll with the punches, talk out loud, cause that's what they always want you to do in interviews. Like make sure that you're verbalizing what's going on in your head, because if not, you just look like a dumb brick.
And you don't want to be a dumb brick in an interview. And so I'm doing all of that and trying to think through it as all these different personas until suddenly there is nothing in my brain. So there's nothing coming out of my mouth because there is literally nothing in my brain.
And I'm sitting there in this interview room. Adobe is. Has anyone been to the Adobe campus? Hey, it's filled with glass everywhere, right? So like all the conference rooms filled with glass. And I'm in this conference room that's looking out over a street and as I'm staring off into the distance trying to think about something.
I see a tumbleweed just go across the road and I'm like, that's my brain. That's it. That's exactly what's happening for me right now. And I just, I kind of give up at that point and I'm like, I got nothing for you guys. I have no idea.
How to solve this problem? I have no idea what you're looking for here. And they were like, that's OK. But it was that that's OK when you know it's not really OK. It's like, you really screwed this one up, kid. That's what they were thinking. And I had nothing really to lose. And so I said.
If you don't mind me asking, what were you looking for here? They're like, well, we were hoping you would look at it from a machine learning perspective. And I said stop, stop, stop. OK, OK, hang on. So what I do is I do a training data set and I do a scoring data set and I do a KNN algorithm and I do Naive Bayes and I just vomited everything I'd learned from all of my ML classes.
I've ever taken an IS, which you guys probably don't even know what that is because that's such old ML. But like they they were just like, OK, thank you. But again, it was just like we just fed you the answer. Of course you're going to get it now. And they were right. Like I totally missed on that answer.
And they were about ready to they they were. They said, all right, that's pretty much all we got. Is there anything you want to talk about before we sign up? We're we're pretty much done here.
What I said after that changed my life, and that sounds really overstated and overblown. Or it sounds like I'm ready to, like, pitch a pyramid scheme to you. I'm not going to do that. But in this case, this was one of those moments where what I did next really.
Did have a huge impact on me. It helped me get the job. Spoiler alert. I mean, you guys know I work at Adobe. I'm so sorry, Eddie. I should have waited to the end. You're like honestly disappointed in me. I'm so sorry, but it helped me get the job at Adobe. It helped me develop.
So many tools that I'm so grateful that I've been able to develop, both technical and business wise, and it helped me provide for my family and that's been a huge blessing in my life. And before we get into what I said in that moment, I'm going to leave you on a little cliffhanger and we're going to pivot to something that seems completely.
Unrelated, which is customer clarity. Now we've talked a lot about customers. We've talked about how to engage with customers. We did a very brief and this is called foreshadowing poster board exercise a couple of weeks ago that we're going to go deeper on today.
Yeah, Cameron, you got this. You can also join with, you can also join with Joseph, but we're we're going to be doing some of that exercise today and we've talked about the customer, but we haven't really gone into the customer.
The depth that I think we need to for you to be successful in this course and for you to get what I want you to get out of this course. Casey's also talked with you about. I think you guys have done some market research with AI and ML. How many have actually gone through with that?
Nice. Was it helpful? Nice, very helpful. Good. We're going to talk about that a little bit more in depth as well where that is a very, very good tool, but it comes with a warning as well. So customer clarity, if you can get the right customer, these all build on each other, they cascade.
If you get the right customer, then you can get the right problem, right? This goes back to our systems thinking, which leads to understanding who is competing for that customer.
Which then allows you to know what is the right way for you to differentiate yourselves. Customer and differentiation. These are the two huge ones we're going to be talking about today and we're going to be doing exercises around that all leads to the right hypothesis, which the hypothesis is really what you're taken out into the world and you're testing and you're.
You're throwing it into the world and you're seeing what the world gives back to you. That's what you're doing.
OK, quick question for you guys. By raise of hands, is this a customer? Who thinks small business owners are customers?
Nice. Who thinks small business owners are not customers?
Nobody raised the guy. This is not, by the way, this is not like a moral 3/5 compromise sort of thing. Like that's not what I mean by like, are they customers OK?
Why would you? Who would say that? Who raised their hand that this is a customer? Why would you say they're a customer? Go ahead. And I'm sorry, remind me of Blake. OK, Blake. Actually, hang on before you do that. I've been trying really hard to get everybody's names, but not everybody puts their photos in Slack. So I just, I'm having a hard time. So I'm gonna go through real quick.
Eddie, Cameron, Joseph or Joe, Which do you go by?
Both. OK, Preston.
Daniel, you messing with me? Where's Preston?
So sorry, Daniel.
I never doubted for a minute you were Daniel. OK, so there's a Daniel and there's a Danny, right? Cause Danny usually sits up here. Hey, and Dylan, right? Dylan.
I can't remember. Hayden. OK, Hayden. Got it. David. David said with confidence. Thomas Blake. I almost forgot your name again.
So sorry, James. OK, James, Kevin.
I just remember the Gator guy. Like, that's how I remember you, man. What's your name? Patrick. Not even close to Kevin. Not even close to Kevin. James. James. Kevin. I don't know. Oh, no, you're not Kevin.
Patrick. James. Patrick. Patrick. Patrick. I'm never calling you Kevin again.
Caleb. OK, Caleb. I've already got over you, Blake. I don't remember. I'm so sorry. Thomas. Oh, wait, I thought there there. No, hang on. Do we have 3 Thomas's? Just the two. OK, Thomas. Thomas. Thomas. Don't remember. Braden. OK, Braden. Matt.
Maddie. Oh, I know this one. Parker. Parker. OK. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I know. Because you actually are one of the ones that have Slack. Can't remember though. Brian. Ryan. Ryan. OK.
And I'm going to really try hard to remember all of that now. Hang on, Patrick. Caleb. OK, Caleb.
OK, Blake, you were saying that they are a customer. Why do you think they're a customer?
OK.
OK, excellent points. Excellent points. I agree with you on every single one of them. I will tell you I don't think they're a customer. Why? Why wouldn't I think they're a customer? Go ahead, Maddie.
Yep.
Correct.
Correct. That's exactly right. Hannah. Good. Hannah, right. Good to see you. I'm sorry. I just went through everybody's names, just making sure I got everybody. OK, Maddie, from my perspective, you're spot on. This is a very, very valuable demographic to understand.
But it's not a customer. If you can't name a specific human in a specific moment, then you don't really have a customer. You're you have the idea of a customer and that's not the same thing. And that's actually the danger of using purely a I in these sorts of market research things.
It's very, very valuable. You need to make sure that you're doing it at the right time though. So do you guys remember way back? I think it was our first lecture where I was saying humans don't optimize for accuracy, they optimize for coherence. And A I is the best coherence engine that has ever been invented.
Right. So that's what you're going to get. If you are targeting A demographic, you're going to get a coherent story that breaks. Go ahead, Matt.
Yes, yes, that's exactly right. So you have to have the exact right user personas and they should be based off a real example of a user. OK, we're going to go to the Miro board real quick.
Do I have it over there? OK, we're going to go to the Miro board and you're going to load.
And I want you to just take.
3 minutes.
And think about your current project. It's Tuesday at 2:17 PM. Your customer is frustrated. What just happened? You've got to name a specific person. You've got to describe a concrete moment. There can't be vague language, and you've got three sentences Max, so go for it.
We're gonna listen to the dulcet tones of 2000 pop. No, we're not. No, we're not. Hug your ears, everybody. I'm so sorry. Instrumental jazz it is.
I was just, I was just thinking, man, simpler time. And then all of a sudden the candy shop comes on, OK.
We're back.
This one was the other one was better.
Solid one.
Oh, please put your name on them as well. I want to make sure that you guys get credit for in class participation.
Hey, you got about one minute left.
OK, it's about time.
I got to say, I love jazz music, but even I thought we were working in an elevator on that one.
Well, I'll, I'll find a better mix. Requests are welcome. OK, but not always adhered to. OK. Are there any in particular that, I mean, we got time for maybe one or two if anyone wants to share something in particular.
About a customer.
No, that's erfectly fine. Just hold on to him. Hang on.
Let me share the screen again.
The concurrent slide.
OK.
Now we're going to be using these poster boards. Eddie, if you could help me out, can you pass those out for me and.
And James, James, and you pass out some of those markers and make sure take the post-its and just make sure everyone's got like each group has like 30 each or so. Yeah, 30 just about.
One per group, and also situate yourselves in your group if you're not already. I know we're a little bit scarce today, so if you don't, if your group isn't there in full, just partner with another group for now, OK?
Cool.
So while you're doing that, we're not actually going to fill this board out fully, right? That exercise was helpful, but we're not actually going to do it in full this time.
It's Ryan Tetro, right? Ryan Tetro, OK.
Yeah, you know, I'm like, I'll be coming. I'll be coming here. I'll see you.
OK.
Uh.
Yes.
OK, so it looks like everyone's pretty much situated, so let's continue on.
We're not going to actually fill out the poster boards the same way we did last time, but we're going to very much focus on the customer and we're going to fill out the problem. We're going to talk about the competition, but really we're getting deep into the customer and the.
Differentiation today. So no need to fill this out, but just as we go along, you're going to write out different areas about the customer. You're going to be using the sticky notes to again to like fill out what you think is the right customer, et cetera.
And you're just going to follow along with the prompts as we go on those. And then if you also remember, we had something called a founding hypothesis. Do you guys remember this founding hypothesis? Do you remember what the value of this founding hypothesis is?
Correct. Alignment is one of the messiest parts of any project. This gets you not necessary alignment, but it gets you initial alignment. It gets you in the right direction so that you can iterate on it.
OK, do not fill out the back of the poster board yet. We're actually going to be doing a couple other exercises on the back. OK, but just remember these two, we're going to revisit them as we go. Let's continue the story time a little bit so.
You left me in the interview and I was just about to say something, hopefully good, so that it would actually get me my job rather than blowing this interview that I've already blown.
To understand what happened next, you have to go back about a year, OK? And you go back a year and I'm sitting on a bus. OK, I have recently been married and I have made the lovely decision to live in my in-law's basement.
It.
With everything that entails. I love my in-laws, by the way. They're wonderful.
You can come to me for marriage advice later on on whether that is a really smart idea for the first year of your marriage to live with your in Ma's basement. But I am commuting from Sandy to Provo every single day, Monday through Friday. And because I'm a poor college student, I'm not driving. I am taking the bus.
And guess what? I hate the bus. I hate it so much. I get nauseated on the bus. There's the smell of gasoline. The bus stops and starts every, like, 5 seconds. The driver. I'm sure he's a wonderful driver. I'm sure it's the bus. I'm positive it's the bus.
The bus handles like a beached whale. It's just a terrible experience over like the bus is terrible. But the by far the worst part about the bus is that I have no idea if I am going to be late for class, or if I'm going to be late for getting on the bus, or if I'm.
Just completely missed the bus at all. And the bus, sometimes it shows up 10 minutes early and sometimes it shows up 10 minutes late, and sometimes it breaks down and UTA comes and lets you know about an hour after when you've been waiting there at the bus stop for an hour wondering what you're going to do for your class.
This is all hypothetical, of course.
So yes, there are many things that I hate about the bus. I looked for a bus application like a a UTA app for a couple of months, trying them on iPods. I it was an iPod at the time and like.
I didn't have an Android, but like seeing if there was an Android app, there was nothing really good out there. There were some apps that were giving timetables and stuff like that, but I didn't need timetables. I needed to make sure that I wasn't late. And you guys might also know one interesting characteristic about me if.
The start of today's class was any indication to you. I don't always start on time. I don't always get there on time. I'm not one of those that's like 5 minutes early is if you're not 5 minutes early, you're late, right? I'm just usually if I'm late, I'm late and I'm usually late.
So that's how I am with buses. And so I'm looking for this app and at the same time I'm taking a course on Objective-c mobile app native development taught by Professor Steven Little.
Do you guys know Stephen Little? He's still teaching. He's he's still here, right? I love Stephen Little. He's so good. Every time I go up, I I introduce myself to him probably once every three years. He never remembers me, but he's still just like the nicest guy ever. Like, I just love Stephen Little.
But but yeah, what? What did you say?
Oh yeah, yeah. Tell him how he won't Remember Me. But he had this Objective C class and he said for your projects, it's open-ended. Whatever you want to do might potentially be some of the inspiration behind this course that we're having right now. And I was just like, OK, well, this is open-ended.
I hate the bus. Major reason is there's no app to really help me with the bus. Maybe I could make an app that is able to track where the buses are and make sure that I get there on time and make sure that I'm not running late. And if I am running late, I can let somebody know and that's that sort of thing, right? So I dig deep into UT.
APIs I I dig deep into Objective C programming. I make a fairly complex application that is not this application by the way, but I make a fairly complex application in the course of a semester. It was called Bus Buddy.
And it was lovely. It was it. Yeah, it was lovely. I made this Bus Buddy app and it was so I had so much fun making it and got so engaged with it that I decided to continue with it afterward and I turned it into my capstone project for my MISM.
And I also submitted it into a mobile app competition. And I don't know if they do mobile app competitions anymore. They used to. It's like a yearly thing. It was really big.
Blank faces make me realize they don't do that anymore and that's a that's a tragedy. But I submitted it in and I got second place in it, which what do you know, that's almost good. And so so I was just like this, this could be something. I should put this on the App Store.
So I do my capstone, I submit it on the App Store and before I do it on the App Store, I'm just like, I need to make sure that I get awareness out there. And so I go and I I go to different UTA parking lot and I was that guy. I had like 5000 Flyers, just little tiny Flyers.
And I just blanketed everybody's windshield with one of those in all of these different locations. And so I got all the word out and then I submitted to the App Store and I got over the course of two weeks, I got 3 downloads.
Yes, yes, that's pretty darn good. That's.
I put the Flyers on as I released it to the App Store. So I released it that like I released it the day before and then I blanketed it. I see where you're going with that. That's a very great question. It's like, why are you advertising something that's not there, you idiot. But I didn't do that one. I wasn't that bad.
I was idiotic in other ways, but that was not the one. So all right.
We're going to pause on the story again and we're going to come back to this. But there are three major outcomes I want you to get out of that experience that I had was that your pain does not equal the market's pain. OK, my pain of missing the bus and being late and wanting to know exactly where the bus was so that I wasn't late.
It's not everybody's pain when they're riding the bus. In fact, most people, I guess most people are on time, so most people didn't end up pain. Advertising and visibility do not fix weak positioning. I advertised as much as my.
Broke little MISM student pocketbook would let me and nobody downloaded it. Not because they didn't know about it, but because they didn't care. And the third one is knowing who your real customer is changes the battlefield. It changes how you engage with them, OK?
I realized that I was not the actual customer. If I wanted it to scale anywhere beyond just having a personal application, I was not my own customer. OK, those are some key findings. Let's actually.
Get into this step one, who is your customer? Who exactly is your customer? You need to be specific. You're not looking for demographics right now. You guys are now working on a mid-term project that hopefully is going to turn into your final project, right?
And Hammond, you're going to do amazing. Whatever team you're on. Are you on this team? OK, you're going to do amazing then. OK, cool. I thought you didn't have any team members here, but of course you did. Joe. Yeah, I'm sorry, Joe. Of course you're here.
Um.
Yeah. So you're going to be working with these customers. How many of you have actually, I'm, I'm guessing you have Joe, because I know you guys have your own business that you're trying. How many people have reached out to a customer at this point?
Parker, did you raise your hand?
Oh, oh, no, no, no. Reached out to a customer for your project.
Have you reached out to anybody or your your your? How many customers have you spoken to?
Yeah.
Other.
OK, gotcha, gotcha. We'll come back to that in a minute. But think about who exactly is your customer. If you were to cold call somebody today, who would that person be? Be Bill Gates? If it is, maybe you should think of a different customer, but.
I mean, but maybe not. Maybe he's the right guy. So talk with your team. Actually, I'm sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. Take 3 minutes, write down a couple of customers on your sticky notes and at the top of your board, just put customer.
Right there and try to answer this question. Who are actually? I think I have other prompts that might be better.
Yeah, so try to answer on each of your sticky notes for each customer that you write down. Try to answer these questions. Who are they? Where do you find them? What context are they in when the pain hits?
Hey, and we'll get we'll get into the pain in a second, but.
OK, you've got 3 minutes to do that.
Where are we?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, one sticky note per customer and try to answer. Hang on.
All right, slide. So the customer.
For each customer, try to answer this. Who are they? Where do you find them? What context are they in when the pain hits for whatever solution you're providing?
OK.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, that.
OK, about 30 seconds left.
OK, let's put a pause right there.
Take a look at your list of customers that you got on there. Just put all the sticky notes under the customers. Now without saying anything, I want you guys to just you might have a couple of customers. Now you should read through them and you should put a dot, just one dot.
On which one you think is the actual primary customer that you want to 1st focus on? OK, that doesn't mean the other ones aren't customers, but for your first shot, for your first iteration, who's the customer that you're really solving this for? OK.
You got about two minutes to do that, so read through the customers. Put one dot from your marker on whatever post-it note you've got.
Yeah, about one minute left on that one.
OK, about 30 seconds.
We have to be touching that. I think I should like this. I think wait for you. I'm waiting here on this, right? You know, all the.
Which one of you guys picked or have you picked one?
Caitlin, my girl, Patrick.
My girlfriend, her apartment and shopping and cooking. Hate shopping and cooking. OK, very interesting.
OK, let's wrap it up.
If you have a tie between them, flip a coin at this point.
OK, everyone, everyone got one customer that they want to focus on. Think of this as the customer you're aiming for for your midterm projects, OK.
Is this the guy or girl? Okay.
Let's move on. We're going to go through this one pretty quickly, like I mentioned the.
Hey guys, let's circle back real quick.
OK, looks like everyone's still talking. I'll give you 10 seconds to figure it all out. Go ahead. Yes, you may.
OK, now it's all good. I I am flushed with sticky notes, so of course there you guys go. You guys all looking good with sticky notes, OK.
Cool, cool. OK, so let's go back to this one. Let's look at the pain and the problem. Now, if you guys remember, the pain and the problem is coming from your understanding of the system.
What's the bottleneck? What's the what's the leverage point? What's the problem in the system that you're actually trying to solve, right? So we don't necessarily need to fill take too much time on here, but I want you to just fill out.
What are some of the? Do the same exact exercise. Write down a couple of the pain points and then identify which one you're actually trying to solve for that customer right now.
Yeah, so what's the problem? And then vote on which one you think is the one that you want to target for your project first.
OK.
Yes, please. Thank you, Eddie. That's a great point. Yeah, please write out pain or pain point or something and then just put the sticky notes under it.
Everyone online still doing OK?
Yeah.
I'm assuming.

Alex Fankhauser   39:12
Yep, doing good.

Jason Johnson   39:16
Cool.
I don't think so. Yeah, it should be almost like once.
Hey, about 30 seconds left on that one.
OK, hopefully you've decided on what is the main pain point of the main problem you want to solve for that customer. So put the dots on it, take all the other sticky notes, put them off to the side for now.
Also as a quick aside, as a quick aside, last time we did this exercise, if you guys remember, we had like 3 different things that you could do, three different pitches and you guys kind of iterated on on one of those. And then I think a couple of you were just asked like, so do we keep this or what? And I was just like just throw it away, right for this one.
You can still throw it away, but I'm hoping that you would take a picture before, because this is the exercise that should be very valuable for you with what you're doing for your midterm project. And if it isn't, then that might mean a couple of things, and some of them might be that.
Maybe you don't have the right solution actually, or maybe you don't have the right customers that you're looking at. Or maybe you haven't dug into it enough to give something meaningful for your midterm project. So think about it in that way. This is this one is really supposed to help you start thinking deeply about.
How your project is really solving customers needs and differentiating it against any competition. OK, cool.
Let's move on the competition and alternatives. You guys know competition always exists. This is a direct copy of a slide from that we've seen before. There are tools, workarounds, there's doing nothing. What you should first target is what's the 800 LB gorilla?
What's the one that is dominating the space? Understand what they're doing, right? That's the one that you. And that's not to say that the other ones and the other alternatives aren't important, but you need to definitely identify among all your other competition, what is the 800 LB gorilla in a room?
So.
Actually, I would rather you. Nope, this next one.
So identify your competition, talk about what they do today, why is it good enough and where does it fail? You've got you got 5 minutes to do that one. This one's a little bit takes a little bit longer.
And I want you to get this one right because it's important for differentiation.
OK, about two more minutes.
OK, about 30 seconds left.
Start wrapping it up. Identify what the main competition is as well as the alternatives. You don't need to necessarily put the other competitors aside, just make sure you know who the 800 LB gorilla is.
OK.
Let's get on to differentiation.
Oh yes, if you haven't voted, take it, take a minute and vote. And you don't necessarily need to vote on what is the only competition. Just vote on what is the biggest competition, right?
Hey, about 15 seconds left.
OK, let's bring it back in.
Let's bring it back in and we're going to talk about the we're going to talk about.
The meats of this lecture.
I think may be the most important part of this lecture. We're going to talk about differentiation now.
Now last time when I was talking about this a couple, all right everyone, come back. Thank you. When I was talking about this a couple of weeks ago, we went in, we went very, we kind of skated over differentiation and I asked you these questions.
Why would they switch? What changes the trade-off? That was filler that for that lecture. We're going to go much deeper now and we're going to get something that's much more meaningful.
Before we do that.
Part three of the story time. So I had just debuted my first app in the App Store and I got 3 downloads and one of them was my parents. So it was not great for me. It was not a great moment.
And I I mean, I could have just left it at that. I got an A. I finished the capstone. It wasn't important anymore, right? But I was curious. I was like, why did that fail? Why didn't that work? How? How does anyone get successful?
With these sorts of apps in the App Store. And so I started tinkering with it. I went to, I went to like UVU. I found out, by the way, BYU, not really commuter school. Most people don't ride the bus like me into BYU.
UVUA lot more people ride the buses. So what I would do is I'd stand outside by the bus stop and I had like a survey checklist thing and when they would get off the bus, I would say, hey, I was wondering if you had some time and I just walk with them to class.
And I would just say, what do you think about this app or what would be like the most pain point that you're running into as a person riding the bus? And if there was an app, what would be the main thing that would really like get you to download it? And so I just kind of do like customer interviews with them.
On their way to their classes, OK. And then I would ask like price points. I was like, so if I could make an app that would do what you're asking, how much would you pay for it? And I kind of figured out like where they would pay and everything like that. And I found out some really interesting things about it.
I I did that at UVUI did that at EU of U as well. And then I did that just on tracks, trains. I was really annoying to a lot of people and I got a ton of good information and what I found out was that most people.
Do not actually ride the bus who are using ETA riding the frontrunner, they're riding the tracks lines and they're riding the buses inside Salt Lake City. That's where the huge density is. And most people don't. I mean, they really want to know where the bus is at that exact moment. So they really like the.
Live updates, but they really want simplicity. They want to be able to open an app, click on a favorite, see the bus, see their routes, see how it connects to where they want to go on a daily routine. That's what they're looking for.
And so I realized I didn't have the right product, I didn't have the right market and I wasn't targeting the right customers. So I just kind of revamped everything. That sounds like a moment where you burn everything down and you start from scratch. And that's essentially what I did.
I built a new app which turned into Route Tracker. You can see this is much better. Add 6 followers on Facebook. Yes, how many what?
I know. Oh, hey, thank you. Your page is very, very much appreciated. I actually just revived that page yesterday because I shut it down like eight years ago. But but yeah, so.
I I started identifying who those customers were and I started building for them based on the feedback that I received from them on what an actual product would would be that would be successful in this area. And then I started.
I I put it out in the App Store. I started blanketing the area with the UTA Flyers again, but this time I was targeting Frontrunner tracks areas and I started getting more downloads. I started getting actually a lot more downloads and then KSL ran an article.
And they said the Green Line has just opened that goes to the airport and I went bingo.
And so has anyone ever tried to get something into KSL, like an article to KSL or do reporting? Anyone know how to do that? I didn't either, but I just called it KSL, like the random phone number that you find on Google and I got passed around to like 8 different people.
But eventually I got to somebody and I said, hey, I'm a student at BYU. I know sometimes you run articles about BYU students and I noticed that the green line just opened. I have an app that's tracking that green line and that would be really helpful for the people using it.
Maybe you'd be interested in writing an article about that. And the guy was like, sure. And so he wrote an article about it, posted it in KSL and.
It's not there. Hang on.
Where's my other?
OK, I have way too many pages open. Is this the one? This is the one.
BYU soon creates real-time UTA tracking app for iPhone. Look at that. They made an article about this app. And by the way, before you judge, that was super cool looking 12 years ago, 14 years ago. That was cool. All right, looks ugly now, but that came from a lot of user research.
That's what the people wanted. That's what I gave them. And so you can see they they did it. They did a pretty good job. They just captured like everything that it did. They took some screenshots of it.
And then they posted it out the comment section. They are so, so mean. I am still, I am still like reeling from some of these comments. They've deleted some of the worst ones, but like they were just vicious and and yeah, so like this guy is just like.
Guy from the article who invented an app that's already been invented. I remember waiting for a bus for 3045 minutes, finding it had broken down or came 10 minutes early. Has anyone ever had a bus arriving like that? You know, they're just mean throughout this whole thing until you get to the very end. Because let's see. Yeah, this on down. Look at these. These are all really nice because that is my family and friends.
Jumping in and trying to change the tide of things. But there's there's so like they were they were just so mean. There were some people who were just that one. But and there's a reason I told you about the comments. I'll come back to that in a second, but.
When I put it in KSLI got thousands of downloads in it in like in a day like it jumped up to like, I think it was #2 in navigation on the App Store for a couple of weeks, which was really, really cool for me. Like people were just downloading it and spoiler alert.
It was not the best overall app out there, but it was the best overall app for real-time tracking and ease of use. And that's what got me a lot of customers really, really quickly.
I read those comments and they stung initially, but then I realized that a lot of those comments were right. And one of the things that they kept saying was that this guy just created an iPhone app. What about all the Android people? And I've done a lot of research on Android and I found out that Android people were typically.
Used to being cheapskates. Android people don't like paying for apps. iPhone people are used to being gouged and so like they would pay for the apps, but I Android people wouldn't pay for the apps. But I also realized one of my biggest demographics.
One of my biggest customer profiles that was missing were U of U students. And I say that with a heavy heart, but that's who I was targeting. And U of U students, their commuter school, they have tracks going right up to the door. And so I went down to EU of U. First of all, I contacted.
That one of the people put a comment and actually I can show you the comment.
Where they were saying, let's see.
People on this message board need to chill out. Not that one. Some serious security issues. There was one that was like talking about how this is like the downfall of America. I think that one might have been removed, but like, I was just amazed. Where is it?
Here it is. There's already an app that does that for Android for free.
So I looked at that and I found out the name of the guy and I found him on LinkedIn and I pinged him. And I was like, hey, I got an iPhone app. You got an Android app. And his app actually was pretty legit for an Android app. It did pretty close to everything I did. I was like, hey, our biggest market is.
U of U and that area, why don't we partner on going to EU of U and getting our apps into EU of U? And so we went there. Well, I went there actually initially and I just went around from building to building. I did this over like 3 days.
I went from building to building, trying to find out who the guys are that I'm supposed to talk to to try to get my app as the app in EU of U. And eventually I found like the king of transportation or something, president of transportation, the king of transportation at EU of U and.
And I just walked into his office and I said, hey, we've got these really cool apps. We want to partner with you of you. What do you guys need? And he said that's a really cool idea. This is what we need. And so Jeff Hillman and I became good friends and we built, he built an Android app and I built another.
Tracker app that was specific for EU of U that tied into EU of U has its own transit authority as well. So it was tracking their buses and UTA's buses, and it was following their Twitter feed and all of their notifications that were coming in.
And then we blanketed EU of U with Flyers and we got a lot more customers that way.
I did that for about two years, and over the course of two years I made just a little bit over 40 K, which if you look at all of the hours I spend, that's like a buck an hour. So really, really great payment. 40 K is not great over 2 years.
For for if I were trying to do this for a real life business as a side project, it was pretty fun. OK, so that goes back to what we were talking about with differentiation. Hang on PowerPoint.
And I'm going to lay from the current slide.
And this goes right into differentiation, where you need to choose your battlefield. Has anyone ever read The Art of War?
You read The Art of War, Caleb. Caleb. You've read The Art of War. Good job. I read it and I.
It wasn't great, at least I wasn't. I didn't think it was, but there was something really important in it that I think he kept saying. And the interesting thing about The Art of War was this guy was talking all about how you engage with the enemy, but most of the time.
You weren't actually even fighting with the enemy. You were picking where you were going. You were picking the terrain. You were identifying where the enemy was weakest, and then you were engaging with them in that point. And sometimes you didn't even need to fight them and you could win the war.
So that's kind of the main point that I got out of the Art of War attack where your competition is weakest and the way that you do that is through differentiation. It's the essence of your strategy. This is one of the most important things that you can do right now when you're starting a project.
And not just not just entrepreneurial, but when you're starting any new projects in any company, this is one of the major things that you should be doing. And good differentiation is what makes your product click with customers. As I mentioned, I'd already blanketed the area with a lot of ads people were not.
Downloading my stuff until they actually really needed it, until I actually had the right differentiation.
It's the essence of the strategy, OK? And this is this is how you can view differentiation at the start of a project in design, in build, in launch and in growth. That differentiation, how you define that is exactly the same throughout. It is what stays constant.
Throughout the process, or at least you hoe it does it it can be tweaked, but this is this should be like one of the backbones of your project.
Now there are a lot of different ways that you can differentiate. These are pretty classic differentiators. You should be doing your own custom differentiators. But I want you to look at these and I want you to write 4 down just on the you guys have another half on your board. Oh, we've got 10 minutes left.
OK, you've got another half on your board. Take 5 minutes, write down four of these, and then I want you to place where your ideal project would fall on those.
Scales. OK, so for example, if your project if you were expecting it to be a really manual thing.
Then you would put a sticky note here, or maybe here. There's some manual, there's some automation. If you're expecting it to be really, really automatic, where it's just turnkey, the customer just downloads it and it works for them perfectly and it solves all the problems. It's automatic.
OK, so grab four of these really quick and put sticky notes somewhere on the spectrum.
4 lines, 4 lines. So siloed, integrated, complicated, simple, unfocused, focused, expensive, free. You've got 5 minutes to do that one.
We're running a bit close to time, so gotta hurry through this part.
OK.
Oh.
OK, about two minutes left, so start putting your sticky notes.
On the spectrum.
OK, about 30 seconds left.
All right. We unfortunately need to pause right there. We're coming down to about four minutes left. We got about 8 minutes that we got to cover. So I'm going to try to go a little bit fast through this. Try to keep up with me because this is honestly one of the most important parts of the whole lecture.
For these dimensions, for these differentiators, you should find if I'm looking at you guys's, you've got one that's free and one that's fast, right? And these are both up there. Simple is really high up there as well. What you want to do now, this is a this is a one by two, right?
You need to put it as a two by two now. So for you guys you would have whoa, good heavens. You would have expense. Nope. You'd have expensive here and free up here and then slow here and fast here.
OK. And then your stuff on both of those differentiators would be in the very top right. OK, you want to find the differentiators where you are the only one in the top right if your competitors are up there.
Then that means that you're not going to win in that area, or you're not guaranteed to win in that area. OK, so you should be looking at all of these different differentiators that you have. Make custom differentiators, find out where you're going to win, and find out where all of your competition is in this L, which you can think of as.
As the losers, that's where the losers are, OK.
Any questions on that?
Go ahead, Parker.
Yeah, pick of those differentiators. Pick two of them.
Mm-hmm. One's on the Y, one's on the X axis.
You picked 4 for variation. What you should ideally do with your team is go through way more differentiators than just four. So what you should look at is if you have two differentiators where you're really high up there.
Yeah. Then then look at those and then look at where and be honest, look at where your competition is. And if your competition is up there with you, able to compete with you, then maybe that's not the right differentiator for you. Maybe that's not where you should focus all your time.
OK.
Hey.
I'm going to have to pause you there. You're going to have to do this as a team outside of class. I just want to wrap up a couple of really important things. First of all, this whole thing that I'm doing, this might. I hope this doesn't feel like a gimmick. This is not a gimmick. This is one of the most important things that you guys can do as you're building out new projects. You guys know.
Who that is? That's Steve Jobs. He's got the iPhone up there. Easy to use, smart. And he's got all of these smartphones, hard to use and not so smart, right? These are the losers. This is him presenting the iPhone. He found it was important enough.
To show how he was differentiating to the group to to the whole world. That's what he showed to the whole world, right? And nobody even cared that the iPhone, the original iPhone, was single-threaded, right? It could only run one application at a time. You had to close all the other applications.
Right. Nobody cared about that because what people cared most about was that it was easy to use and it was smart. OK, I will also say this sort of analysis that we're doing, you guys know that I've been like flying out all over the place and I'm so tired.
But I've been flying out all over the place. These sorts of meetings are the things that I'm flying out for and it's it's with like senior V PS and directors and these are all people who have really, really high, much higher salaries than I do.
And they are spending all of their time trying to figure this out because it's that important, right? And they're willing to fly out the sky from Utah all over the place and, you know, expense all of that because it's that important to get this right. These are the conversations that I'm having for days and days and days.
This falsifiability. You should take these same dimensions that we've been talking about differentiators, and you should look at it from different lenses because you need to be able to prove yourself wrong, right? You need to be able to to make sure that you can falsify your own views.
So take a look at these slides, try to go through these different lenses, like how is the customer actually going to see you? They might see you way differently than you think, right?
OK, then finally write the founding hypothesis. I got to finish the story real quick. We're back at Adobe and all I said, I didn't say much. I just said I've written an app. I wrote an app and I pulled out the bus buddy. It was the bus buddy at the time.
I pulled out the bus buddy and I gave it to him and they freaked out about it and they just started asking me so many questions like what's the database behind this? How are you deploying it? How have you like, how are you hooking into all this, the geolocation, everything like that? I was able to answer all of it because I mean, I've just been doing it for months and months and months. It was super easy.
And they realized that this kid.
Wasn't an idiot. He just looked like an idiot. So he was actually a pretty good hire and they hired me. This app that I've been talking through this whole process is the reason that I got my job at Adobe. But everything that I was talking about, like all of the customer research, everything, everything like that, that is just one of those things that.
Has really helped me in my job. I do this sort of thing. This was on a little small scale. It was a fun scale. I do this every single day at very high scales with like Nike and and Xfinity and we've got one with.
Major League Baseball tomorrow. And like, these are the sorts of conversations that we're having every single day. One final thing, you need to be able to reach out to your actual customers and know who they are. I am not an extrovert.
I'm not an introvert. I'm kind of in the middle. Reaching out to people on buses was mortifying to me. It was horrifying. I hated it so much. But you really need to be able to understand who your customer is. You need to be able to think about differentiation, and you need to apply both of those to the heart of your project.
So in the next lecture, we're going to go over communication as a superpower between now and next Monday. I well, next Tuesday really. You should be spending at least 6 to 8 hours between now and next Wednesday preparing for your midterm, and you need to be able to submit all presentation materials and needed artifacts.
And check Learning Suite, I put more details on there by next Tuesday at 11:59 PM. So this is one of those weeks that you guys do need to sync with each other and you need to reach out to actual customers and get real feedback on the projects you're doing. Any questions?
Sorry for going over. Dylan, go ahead.
It is posted. Um, I have it in. Hang on.
Customer feedback is let me tell you how I'm going to grade these. Casey is going to grade them as if he is a senior architect because he is. That's how he's going to grade them. I'm going to grade them as how a senior director or a VP of product would grade them because I'm not, but I know how they think.
Because I work with them all the time, so that's how I'm going to be looking at them. You can do that any way that you want, but that's kind of what we're what we're hoping to get. There is also if you look here on.
Where is it? Come on.
Oh.
No content. Thank you. Who said that? Thank you. If you look at content, midterm project representation or presentation rubric, this has all of it there. And then the assignment itself. Look at the assignment itself because it has more artifacts for you as well. Any other questions?
Thanks, guys. This was fun.
Let me put it this way. If you're going to use a slide deck, you have to submit it by Tuesday. You don't have to use the slide deck though. Make it the most compelling presentation you can in whatever style that makes sense, but make sure that you're ticking off the things that are in the rubric.
So for me personally, I would probably use a PowerPoint, but Casey would not use a PowerPoint. So it's just whatever style you use, yeah.
Yep.
OK.
